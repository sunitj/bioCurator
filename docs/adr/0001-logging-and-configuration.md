# ADR-0001: Logging and Configuration Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Deciders:** Development Team

## Context

BioCurator requires a robust logging and configuration system to support:
- Multi-mode operation (development, production, hybrid)
- Structured logging for observability and debugging
- Configuration validation and schema enforcement
- Correlation tracking across distributed agent interactions
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

The system must be production-ready with comprehensive error handling and fail-fast behavior for critical configuration errors.

## Decision

We will implement:

### Structured JSON Logging
- **Framework**: structlog with JSON formatting
- **Correlation IDs**: Automatic injection of request/correlation IDs
- **Context Variables**: Uses Python contextvars for thread-safe context propagation
- **Error Handling**: Structured error logging with exception details and stack traces
- **Output**: JSON format for production, human-readable for development

### Configuration Management
- **Schema**: Pydantic-based configuration schemas with validation
- **Sources**: Environment variables override YAML configuration files
- **Validation**: Fail-fast on missing critical keys or invalid values
- **Mode-specific**: Different configurations for development/production/hybrid modes
- **Type Safety**: Full type checking and automatic conversion

## Rationale

### Structured Logging Choice
- **structlog**: Provides excellent structured logging with flexible processors
- **JSON format**: Essential for log aggregation and analysis tools
- **Correlation IDs**: Critical for tracing requests across agent boundaries
- **Context variables**: Thread-safe alternative to thread-local storage

### Configuration Architecture
- **Pydantic**: Provides robust validation and type safety
- **Environment override**: Follows 12-factor app principles
- **YAML base**: Human-readable base configuration
- **Fail-fast**: Prevents runtime failures from configuration issues

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Standard logging**: Rejected due to lack of structured output
2. **Config files only**: Rejected due to deployment inflexibility
3. **Environment only**: Rejected due to complex nested configuration needs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent observability and debugging capabilities
- Type-safe configuration with compile-time error detection
- Production-ready logging with proper correlation tracking
- Flexible deployment with environment-specific overrides
- Clear separation of concerns between logging and application logic

### Negative
- Additional dependency on structlog and pydantic
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with structured logging
- Slightly more complex initial setup compared to basic logging
- JSON logs are less human-readable for local development

### Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing of configuration validation
- Documentation and examples for common logging patterns
- Fallback to console logging in development mode
- Error handling prevents silent configuration failures
