# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the BioCurator project.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They provide context about why decisions were made and help future developers understand the reasoning behind current implementations.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Superseded | Deprecated]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [List of people involved in the decision]

## Context

Describe the situation that motivates this decision.

## Decision

Describe what we decided to do.

## Rationale

Explain why this decision was made. Include:
- What alternatives were considered
- What factors influenced the decision
- What trade-offs were made

## Consequences

Describe the positive and negative consequences of this decision.

## References

Include links to relevant resources, discussions, or documentation.
```

## Guidelines for Writing ADRs

1. **Keep it concise**: ADRs should be brief but comprehensive
2. **Focus on decisions**: Document decisions, not just information
3. **Provide context**: Explain why the decision was needed
4. **Include alternatives**: Show what options were considered
5. **Update status**: Keep the status current as decisions evolve
6. **Link related ADRs**: Reference other ADRs that relate to this decision

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making decisions about:

- System architecture and design patterns
- Technology choices and frameworks
- Development processes and workflows
- Security and safety measures
- Performance and scalability strategies
- API design and integration patterns

## ADR Process

1. **Create**: Copy the template and fill in the sections
2. **Review**: Share with relevant team members for feedback
3. **Discuss**: Gather input and iterate on the content
4. **Decide**: Make the final decision and update status
5. **Communicate**: Share the ADR with the broader team
6. **Maintain**: Update status if the decision changes
