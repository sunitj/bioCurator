# BioCurator Development Roadmap
## Pull Request Breakdown and Implementation Guide

---

## Development Philosophy

**Principles**:
- Each PR should be independently testable and deployable
- Maximum 500 lines of code per PR for review quality ⚠️ **Note**: Actual implementation ~2.5-4x estimated LOC
- Comprehensive documentation and tests with each feature
- Progressive complexity building toward final system

**Branch Strategy**: 
- `main` - Production ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for feature PRs
- `feature/*` - Individual feature development
- `docs/*` - Documentation and content PRs

---

##### Implementation Status

**Date Completed**: September 2025
**Safety Module Coverage**: >85% (target achieved)
**All Core Acceptance Criteria**: ✅ COMPLETED

✅ **Fully Implemented**:
  - Complete safety infrastructure from scratch:
    - Event bus with audit logging (src/safety/event_bus.py)
    - Circuit breaker with three states (src/safety/circuit_breaker.py)
    - Token bucket rate limiter (src/safety/rate_limiter.py)

- Circuit breaker state management requires careful thread safety
- Cost tracking needs both development (free) and production pricing
- Anomaly detection requires baseline collection mode

  - Capability profiles for each model: latency_ms_avg, context_window, max_tokens_output, cost_per_1k_tokens(estimated), strengths[], weaknesses[]
  - Quality bridge: local vs cloud comparison producing similarity/accuracy composite score; thresholds documented (e.g., require >=0.85 semantic similarity for summarization tasks)
  - Escalation policy: if score < threshold for N consecutive tasks -> controlled fallback with safety event emission + cost pre-check
  - Caching layer with documented eviction (LRU + TTL) and metrics: cache_hits_total, cache_misses_total, cache_hit_ratio
  - Quantization workflow storing pre/post metrics diff (accuracy_delta, latency_improvement_pct, memory_reduction_pct)
  - CI regression gate failing on performance degradation > defined tolerance (e.g., >10% latency regression or >3% accuracy loss)
  - Integration hook to safety cost tracker before any fallback escalation
SHOULD:
  - Benchmark categories aligned to future agent roles (search, extraction, synthesis, reasoning)
  - Retrieval-aware benchmark placeholder referencing memory integration dependency
  - Model profile change review label (model-profile-change) enforced via CI check
COULD:
  - Adaptive sampling: skip unchanged tasks when model version hash identical
  - Lightweight visualization report (HTML) summarizing benchmarks
DEFINITION_OF_DONE:
  - Benchmark script outputs JSON + markdown summary artifacts

## Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**: Each component has >90% test coverage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability and efficiency benchmarks
- **Agent Tests**: Behavioral validation for each agent

### Code Quality Standards
- **Code Review**: All PRs require 1+ approvals
- **Linting**: Automated code formatting and style checking
- **Documentation**: All public APIs fully documented
- **Security**: Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

### Continuous Integration
- **Automated Testing**: All tests run on PR creation
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regression detection
- **Documentation Building**: Automatic documentation updates
- **Deployment Testing**: Staging environment validation

## Risk Management and Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Agent coordination becomes too complex
**Mitigation**: Implement simple coordination first, add complexity gradually

**Risk**: Memory system performance degrades with scale
**Mitigation**: Implement caching and optimization strategies early

**Risk**: Foundation model costs exceed budget
**Mitigation**: Use smaller models for development, optimize for efficiency

### Project Risks
**Risk**: PR scope creep leads to delays
**Mitigation**: Strict scope control and regular review meetings

**Risk**: Technical complexity exceeds timeline
**Mitigation**: Implement MVP versions first, enhance iteratively

**Risk**: Quality suffers due to rapid development
**Mitigation**: Maintain strict testing and review standards

## Success Metrics and Milestones

### Development Milestones
- **Month 1**: Foundation infrastructure complete
- **Month 2**: Basic agent coordination working
- **Month 3**: Advanced behaviors implemented
- **Month 4**: Memory integration complete
- **Month 5**: Emergent behaviors demonstrated
- **Month 6**: Research contributions documented

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: >90% for all core components
