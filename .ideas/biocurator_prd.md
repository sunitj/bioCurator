**Cost**: $0 - completely free operation
**Safety**: Maximum protection with strict controls

```yaml
development_configuration:
  safety_controls:
    max_requests_per_minute: 30
    cost_budget_per_session: 0.0
    timeout_per_request: 30s
    circuit_breaker_enabled: true
    behavior_monitoring: enhanced
    
  models:
    primary: ollama/deepseek-r1:32b      # Best reasoning
    fallback: ollama/llama3.1:8b         # Fast general purpose
    specialized: ollama/qwen2.5:7b       # Technical tasks
    
  monitoring:
    request_tracking: detailed
    performance_profiling: enabled
    quality_assessment: continuous
    resource_monitoring: comprehensive
```

#### Production Mode (Cloud Models)
**Purpose**: Maximum capability and performance
**Models**: Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, specialized foundation models
**Cost**: Optimized for quality-cost balance
**Safety**: Balanced protection with performance focus

#### Hybrid Mode (Best of Both)
**Purpose**: Cost-optimized operation with quality escalation
**Strategy**: Local-first with cloud escalation for complex tasks
**Cost**: Minimized through intelligent model selection
**Safety**: Adaptive controls based on task complexity

### Agent Safety and Control Systems

#### Rogue Behavior Prevention
```python
class AgentSafetyController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.circuit_breakers = {}
        self.rate_limiters = {}
        self.cost_tracker = CostTracker()
        self.behavior_monitor = BehaviorAnalyzer()
        
    def monitor_agent_request(self, agent_id, request):
        # Prevent infinite loops and cascading failures
        if self.detect_loop_risk(agent_id, request):
            raise InfiniteLoopPrevented(agent_id)
            
        # Control costs and resource usage
        if self.cost_tracker.would_exceed_budget(request):
            raise BudgetProtectionTriggered()
            
        # Detect anomalous behavior patterns
        if self.behavior_monitor.is_anomalous(agent_id, request):
            self.circuit_breakers[agent_id].trip()
            raise AnomalousBehabiorBlocked(agent_id)
```
