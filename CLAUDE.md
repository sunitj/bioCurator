## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The project uses ADRs to document significant architectural decisions:

- **ADR-0001**: Logging and configuration decisions (PR #1)
- **ADR-0002**: Project structure (PR #1)
- **ADR-0003**: Circuit breaker and safety architecture (PR #1.5)
- **ADR-0004**: Local model optimization and quality bridge (PR #2.5)

ADRs are stored in `docs/adr/` and follow the standard ADR template.

## Quality Requirements

### Testing Coverage
- Initial target: >=70% overall coverage (PR #1)
- Safety module: >=85% coverage (PR #1.5)
- Core components: >90% coverage target

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Stages: lint â†’ test â†’ security scan â†’ build
- Security scanning with pip-audit or safety
- Coverage report artifacts
- SBOM generation (CycloneDX format)

### Logging and Monitoring
- Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- Request ID injection for tracing
- Centralized error handling patterns
- Prometheus metrics exposition

## Important Notes

- Always use development mode (local models) for initial testing to avoid costs
- Development mode enforces hard guard against cloud model invocation
- Implement safety controls before any agent coordination work
- Test circuit breakers and rate limiting before production deployment
- Monitor cost tracking actively when using cloud models
- Use memory systems efficiently to avoid performance degradation at scale
- All PRs should be <=500 LOC for effective review
- Follow ADR framework for architectural decisions
